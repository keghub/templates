dotnet new emg-batch-jobprocessor
```

This template creates a console application that can be used to process AWS Batch jobs.

### Hosted Service

```
dotnet new emg-hosted-service
```

This template creates a Hosted Service application. The runtime is selected depending on which workloads are selected.

The application can be customized with the following parameters:
* `--add-nybus Current` adds support for hosting Nybus v1.x handlers
* `--add-nybus Legacy` adds support for hosting Nybus v0.x handlers. Requires .NET Framework 4.8
* `--add-wcf` adds support for hosting WCF services. Requires .NET Framework 4.8
* `--add-aws` adds basic setup to AWS services
* `--force-net48` forces the runtime to be .NET Framework 4.8 even if the application could run on .NET Core 3.1

### Lambda Event Function

```
dotnet new emg-lambda-event
```

This template creates a AWS Lambda function that reacts to event and does not return a response.

### Lambda RequestResponse Function

```
dotnet new emg-lambda-requestresponse
```

This template creates a AWS Lambda function that reacts to event and then returns a response.

### Test Project

```
dotnet new emg-test-lib

This template creates a unit-test project using NUnit 3.x.

It also has references to
* `AutoFixture`
* `Moq`
* `AutoFixture.NUnit3`
* `AutoFixture.AutoMoq`
* `AutoFixture.Idioms`

The project will contain a specialization of `AutoDataAttribute` that configures the Moq glue library for AutoFixture.

### Windows Service

```
dotnet new emg-windows-service
```

This template creates a Windows Service application based on TopShelf.

The application can be customized with the following parameters:
* `--add-nybus Current` adds support for hosting Nybus v1.x handlers
* `--add-nybus Legacy` adds support for hosting Nybus v0.x handlers
